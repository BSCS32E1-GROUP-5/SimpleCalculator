SIMPLE CALCULATOR PROJECT PROPOSAL : BSCS32E1 GROUP - 5
Summary
This proposal aims to enhance the functionality and user experience of the Simple Calculator application. By implementing additional features and improving existing ones, we aim to provide users with a more robust and intuitive tool for mathematical calculations.


Introduction
The current Simple Calculator application provides basic arithmetic operations but lacks advanced features and a modern user interface. This proposal addresses these limitations by introducing new functionalities and enhancing the overall design.


Current Process Analysis
The current Simple Calculator application follows a traditional layout with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). However, it lacks features such as memory functions, scientific calculations, and a history log of calculations. A visual analysis reveals a simplistic design that may not appeal to users seeking advanced functionality.


Proposed Improvement
1. *Memory Functions: Implement memory storage (M+, M-, MR, MC) for storing and recalling numbers during calculations.
2. *Scientific Mode: Introduce a scientific mode with advanced functions like square root, exponentiation, trigonometric calculations, and logarithmic functions.
3. *History Log: Add a history log to display previous calculations, allowing users to review and reuse them if needed.
4. *Improved UI: Redesign the user interface with a modern and intuitive layout, including a responsive design for different screen sizes.

Benefits & Impact
- Enhanced User Experience: The proposed improvements will make the Simple Calculator more versatile and user-friendly, catering to a wider range of user needs.
- Increased Functionality: Addition of memory functions, scientific mode, and a history log will improve the utility of the application for both basic and advanced users.
- Competitive Advantage: With a modern UI and advanced features, the Simple Calculator will stand out among similar applications, attracting more users.
